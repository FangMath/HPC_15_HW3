omp_bug2.c --> "tid" should be a local variable. Also "total" is dangerous
variable because everybody writes on it at same time. Need to use reduction
here

omp_bug3.c --> A barrier is set in "print_results" function. But
"print_results" is called in "omp section" where only on thread sees
this barrier so that it would hang there, but other threads cannot see this
barrier. 

omp_bug4.c --> a[N][N] is too big to fit in thread private memory

omp_bug5.c --> need to release locks before other calls the same lock

omp_bug6.c --> sum needs to be a global variable, otherwise each thread initiates its own copy

Prob2:

The time plot is included in this folder.

1. Good scaling when number of threads is less than 8 (does the node only have
8 threads at most? I've no idea how to request fat nodes...)

2. Jacobi is slightly faster than GS, which is because GS is "half" paralled
compared to Jacobi.

2. I couldn't get icc compiler work...
